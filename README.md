# hex-rip
A browser-based tool to rip hex values from any set of text.

## Vision
The goal here is to use simple regular expressions and JavaScript to pull/rip all hex values (`#42e5f4`, for example) from any pasted text or document that may contain them. All duplicate hex values will be removed and the remaining, unique colors will be displayed, simply and beautifully on the page.

## To Do List
1. ~~Store retrieved values in an array?~~
2. ~~Remove duplicate values from ripped hex list/array.~~
3. Display those values on page for user to see. (organize them in a certain way?)
4. Color those values appropriately.
5. Allow single-click copy and paste of hex values.
