# hex-rip
A browser-based tool to rip hex values from any set of text.

## Vision
The goal here is to use simple regular expressions and JavaScript to pull/rip all hex values (`#42e5f4`, for example) from any pasted text or document that may contain them. All duplicate hex values will be removed and the remaining, unique colors will be displayed, simply and beautifully on the page.

## To Do List
1. Make it look pretty.
2. Let the function run with uploaded files, or via a provided url?
